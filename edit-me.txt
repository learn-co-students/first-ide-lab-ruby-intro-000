Hi there it's me hassan.
A person who writes his own pathetic mistakes and mischiefs he had done in his life and
sometimes I talk Philosophical shit that's why I have a few but fair people around me who are honest.
I want to become a software Engineer. In real my goal is much bigger than that but I know clearly that I need to take short but consistent steps.

"--If a metallurgy engineer can become a CEO of the biggest tech company in the world anything can happen. Literally anything can happen. BELIEVE ME!!!----"


HASSAN out!
